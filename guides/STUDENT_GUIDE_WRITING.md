# Writing Assessment: Student Guide

## What You're Going to Do

You will respond to a writing prompt by planning your ideas, writing a clear response, and checking your work. Great writing isn't about using fancy words—it's about **clear thinking** that your reader can easily follow.

## The Secret to Great Writing: Think First, Write Second

The biggest mistake students make? Starting to write before they know what they want to say.

**Great writers spend MORE time thinking than writing.**

Before you write a single word, you need to know:
1. What is my ONE main message?
2. What points support that message?
3. In what order should I present them?

---

## The "Think First" Framework

Use these 5 steps BEFORE you start writing:

### Step 1: Understand the Situation
**Ask yourself:** "What's happening? What background does my reader need?"

This is the context—the setup that helps your reader understand why your topic matters.

**Example:** If you're writing about screen time, the situation might be: "Teenagers today spend many hours on devices, and adults are concerned."

---

### Step 2: Identify the Challenge
**Ask yourself:** "What's the problem, tension, or interesting question here?"

This is what makes your writing worth reading. What conflict or issue needs to be addressed?

**Example:** "People disagree about whether screen time helps or harms teens—some say it's educational, others say it's damaging."

---

### Step 3: Focus Your Message (MOST IMPORTANT!)
**Ask yourself:** "If I could only tell my reader ONE thing, what would it be?"

This is your MAIN POINT. Everything else in your writing should support this.

⚠️ **WRITE THIS DOWN FIRST.** Don't start writing until you can state your main message in ONE clear sentence.

**Example:** "Screen time is beneficial for teenagers when used intentionally for learning and connection."

---

### Step 4: Build Your Support
**Ask yourself:** "What are 2-4 DIFFERENT reasons that support my main message?"

**The Golden Rules:**
- Each reason must be DIFFERENT (don't repeat the same idea in different words)
- Each reason must DIRECTLY support your main message
- Together, your reasons should cover everything important

**Example:**
- Reason 1: Screen time enables access to educational resources
- Reason 2: Technology helps teens maintain social connections
- Reason 3: Digital skills are essential for future careers

Notice how each reason is a DIFFERENT type of benefit—they don't overlap!

---

### Step 5: Check Your Logic
**Ask yourself:** "Does each supporting point answer 'why?' or 'how?' about my main message?"

Your reader should be able to follow your thinking like a path:
- Main Message → "Why?" → Reason 1
- Main Message → "Why?" → Reason 2
- Main Message → "How?" → Reason 3

If a point doesn't answer "why?" or "how?" about your main message, cut it.

## Writing Structure: The Shape of Clear Thinking

### The Basic Structure

```
PARAGRAPH 1: Introduction
├── Hook (grab attention)
├── Context (situation + challenge)
└── YOUR MAIN MESSAGE (state it clearly!)

PARAGRAPH 2: First Supporting Point
├── Topic sentence (what this paragraph is about)
├── Evidence/examples
└── Explanation (how this connects to your main message)

PARAGRAPH 3: Second Supporting Point
├── Topic sentence
├── Evidence/examples
└── Explanation

PARAGRAPH 4: Third Supporting Point (if needed)
├── Topic sentence
├── Evidence/examples
└── Explanation

PARAGRAPH 5: Conclusion
├── Restate main message (different words)
├── Summary of key points
└── Final thought (why this matters)
```

## The Four Things Your Writing Will Be Judged On

### 1. Main Message & Focus (25%)
**Question:** Is your main point clear from the start?

| Level 4 | Level 3 | Level 2 | Level 1 |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Main message is crystal clear from the opening | Main message is clear and stated early | Main message is present but buried or unclear | Main message is missing or very hard to find |

**How to get Level 4:**
- State your main message in your FIRST paragraph
- Make it specific, not vague
- Don't make your reader guess

---

### 2. Logical Structure (25%)
**Question:** Do your supporting points clearly connect to your main message?

| Level 4 | Level 3 | Level 2 | Level 1 |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Each paragraph answers "why?" or "how?" about the main message | Clear connection between points and main message | Some connection, but logic is unclear | Points seem disconnected or random |

**How to get Level 4:**
- Each body paragraph = ONE clear point
- Every point directly supports your main message
- Reader can follow your logic from start to finish

---

### 3. Grouping & Completeness (25%)
**Question:** Are your ideas organized well? Do they cover everything important without repeating?

| Level 4 | Level 3 | Level 2 | Level 1 |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Ideas perfectly grouped, no overlap, nothing important missing | Well-grouped with minimal overlap | Some overlap or missing points | Ideas jumbled, repetitive, or major gaps |

**How to get Level 4:**
- Your points should be DIFFERENT from each other
- Don't say the same thing in different words
- Together, your points should cover the main arguments (nothing major missing)

---

### 4. Conventions & Clarity (25%)
**Question:** Is your writing clear and error-free?

| Level 4 | Level 3 | Level 2 | Level 1 |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Virtually no errors; exceptionally clear | Few errors that don't hurt understanding | Some errors that may confuse readers | Many errors that make it hard to understand |

**How to get Level 4:**
- Proofread for spelling and grammar
- Vary your sentence length
- Use clear, precise words

## Step-by-Step: How to Complete a Writing Assessment

### STEP 1: Read the Prompt Carefully (2 minutes)
- What type of writing is requested? (narrative, persuasive, informational, response)
- What specific requirements are listed?
- How many words are expected?

### STEP 2: Think First - Plan Your Response (5-8 minutes)
Use the "Think First" framework:
1. What's the SITUATION?
2. What's the CHALLENGE?
3. What's my ONE MAIN MESSAGE? (Write it down!)
4. What 2-4 DIFFERENT points support it?
5. Does each point answer "why?" or "how?"

**Don't skip this step!** Planning = better writing.

### STEP 3: Write Your Draft (15-20 minutes)
- Start with your main message (don't bury it!)
- One paragraph = one point
- Use specific evidence and examples
- Connect each paragraph back to your main message

### STEP 4: Check Your Structure (3 minutes)
Ask yourself:
- Can I state my main message in ONE sentence?
- Does each paragraph have ONE clear purpose?
- Do my points overlap, or are they different?
- Does everything connect to my main message?

### STEP 5: Edit and Proofread (3-5 minutes)
- Check spelling and grammar
- Vary sentence lengths
- Make sure you met the word count
- Read it out loud (in your head)—does it flow?

☐ Together, do my points cover everything important?

### Evidence Check:
☐ Did I include specific examples or evidence?
☐ Does my evidence actually support my points?
☐ Did I explain HOW the evidence connects?

### Conventions Check:
☐ Did I check spelling and grammar?
☐ Did I vary my sentence lengths?

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Burying Your Main Message
**Wrong:** Saving your main point for the conclusion
**Right:** State your main message in paragraph 1

### ❌ Repeating the Same Idea
**Wrong:** "Screen time is educational. Also, you can learn from screens. Plus, screens teach you things."
**Right:** Point 1 = educational resources, Point 2 = social connection, Point 3 = career skills

### ❌ Points That Don't Connect
**Wrong:** Including interesting ideas that don't support your main message
**Right:** Every point answers "why?" or "how?" about your main message

### ❌ Vague Main Messages
**Wrong:** "Screen time is good and bad."
**Right:** "Screen time benefits teenagers when used intentionally for learning and connection."

### ❌ Skipping the Planning Step
**Wrong:** Starting to write immediately
**Right:** Spending 5-8 minutes planning BEFORE writing

## Remember: Clear Thinking = Clear Writing

The goal isn't to impress your reader with big words.

The goal is to help your reader **understand your thinking**.

When you:
- Start with your main point
- Support it with different, non-overlapping reasons
- Make sure each reason answers "why?" or "how?"
- Connect everything back to your main message

...your reader will think: "This person knows what they're talking about."

**That's the goal. Good luck!**
