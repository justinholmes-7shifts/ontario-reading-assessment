# Reading Assessment: Student Guide

## What You're Going to Do

You will read a passage and answer questions that test how well you understand what you read. But this isn't just about remembering facts—it's about **thinking deeply** about what the author is saying and how they say it.

---

## The 4 Skills You'll Practice

### 1. Find the Central Message
**What it means:** Every passage has a MAIN POINT—the ONE big idea the author wants you to understand.

**How to do it:**
- Ask yourself: "If I had to explain this passage in ONE sentence, what would I say?"
- Look at the beginning and end—authors often state their main point there
- Don't get distracted by details—focus on the BIG picture

**Example question:** "What is the central theme of this passage?"

---

### 2. Follow the Author's Reasoning
**What it means:** Good authors don't just state their point—they BUILD an argument with supporting ideas that connect logically.

**How to do it:**
- Notice how the passage is organized (beginning → middle → end)
- Ask: "Why did the author put this part HERE?"
- Look for the STRUCTURE:
  - Does it tell a story? (narrative)
  - Does it explain something? (informational)
  - Does it try to convince you? (persuasive)
  - Does it show a problem and solution?

**Example question:** "How does the author organize this passage to support their argument?"

---

### 3. Evaluate the Evidence
**What it means:** Authors use EVIDENCE to support their points. Your job is to judge: Is this evidence strong? Does it actually prove what the author claims?

**How to do it:**
- When you see a claim, ask: "What proof does the author give?"
- Look for:
  - Facts and statistics
  - Examples and stories
  - Expert opinions
  - Personal experiences
- Ask: "Does this evidence ACTUALLY support the point, or is it weak?"

**Example question:** "Which detail from the text BEST supports the idea that...?"

---

### 4. Make Connections
**What it means:** Great readers connect what they read to OTHER texts, to their OWN lives, and to the WORLD.

**How to do it:**
- **Text-to-Text:** "This reminds me of another book/article I read..."
- **Text-to-Self:** "This connects to my own experience when..."
- **Text-to-World:** "This relates to what's happening in the world because..."

**Example question:** "This story shares themes with [another text]. What lesson do both teach?"

## Step-by-Step: How to Complete a Reading Assessment

### STEP 1: Preview (30 seconds)
Before reading deeply:
- Read the title
- Look at the passage type (fiction, non-fiction, media text)
- Skim the questions so you know what to look for

### STEP 2: First Read (focus on understanding)
Read the whole passage once to understand the MAIN IDEA:
- Don't worry about every detail yet
- Focus on: "What is this ABOUT? What's the author's POINT?"

### STEP 3: Second Read (focus on details)
Read again, this time noticing:
- HOW the author builds their argument
- Key evidence and examples
- Words you don't know (use context clues!)
- Connections to themes you recognize

### STEP 4: Answer Questions Strategically
For each question:
1. Read the question carefully—what skill is it testing?
2. Go BACK to the passage to find evidence
3. Eliminate wrong answers
4. Choose the BEST answer (not just a "good" answer)

### STEP 5: Check Your Work
Before submitting:
- Did you answer every question?
- Did you go back to the passage for evidence?
- Are you choosing answers based on the TEXT, not just your opinion?

## Reading Like a Detective: Questions to Ask Yourself

While reading, keep these questions in your mind:

### About the Main Message:
- What is the author's ONE main point?
- Why did the author write this?
- What does the author want me to think, feel, or do?

### About Structure:
- How is this organized?
- Why did the author put things in this order?
- How does each paragraph connect to the main point?

### About Evidence:
- What proof does the author give?
- Is this evidence convincing?
- Are there any gaps in the reasoning?

### About Deeper Meaning:
- What is the author NOT saying directly?
- What can I infer (figure out) from clues?
- How does this connect to bigger ideas?

## Vocabulary Strategy: Context Clues

When you find a word you don't know:

1. **Read around it** - Look at the sentence before and after
2. **Look for definitions** - Sometimes the author explains it
3. **Find synonyms** - Look for similar words nearby
4. **Use logic** - What word would MAKE SENSE here?
5. **Check the tone** - Is it positive, negative, or neutral?

**Example:**
> "The waters were *treacherous*, requiring a lighthouse to guide ships safely."

You might not know "treacherous," but the context tells you the waters are dangerous (that's why ships need guidance).

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Answering from memory** - Always go BACK to the passage

❌ **Choosing the first "good" answer** - Read ALL options first

❌ **Adding your own opinions** - Stick to what the TEXT says

❌ **Ignoring the question type** - Different questions need different approaches

❌ **Rushing** - Take time to think deeply
