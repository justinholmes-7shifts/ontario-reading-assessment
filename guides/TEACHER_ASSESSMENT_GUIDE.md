## Reading Assessment Rubric (Per Question Type)

### Central Message Questions
*"What is the main theme/central message of this passage?"*

| Level | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **4** | Correctly identifies the overarching theme; understands how details support main idea; can distinguish main idea from supporting details |
| **3** | Correctly identifies the main theme; understands general relationship to supporting ideas |
| **2** | Identifies a theme but may confuse it with a supporting detail or secondary idea |
| **1** | Unable to identify main theme; focuses on minor details or misunderstands passage |

**Feedback Prompts:**
- Level 4: "Excellent! You identified the central theme and understand how the author built their argument."
- Level 3: "Good job finding the main theme. Try to notice how all the details connect to support it."
- Level 2: "You found an important idea, but it's not the MAIN theme. Ask: What ONE point is the author making?"
- Level 1: "Let's work on finding the main idea. Try reading the first and last paragraphs—authors often state their main point there."

---

### Text Structure Questions
*"How does the author organize this passage?"*

| Level | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **4** | Correctly identifies organizational structure; explains HOW structure supports the author's purpose; recognizes sophisticated structural choices |
| **3** | Correctly identifies the organizational pattern; understands basic relationship to content |
| **2** | Identifies some structural elements but may mischaracterize the overall organization |
| **1** | Unable to recognize organizational patterns; confuses structure with content |

**Feedback Prompts:**
- Level 4: "Excellent analysis! You see how the author's structure choices reinforce their message."
- Level 3: "Good identification of the structure. Now think: WHY did the author choose this organization?"
- Level 2: "You noticed some patterns. Try outlining the passage—what does each section DO?"
- Level 1: "Focus on what each paragraph's PURPOSE is. Does it set up a problem? Give evidence? Provide a solution?"

---

### Evidence Evaluation Questions
*"Which detail BEST supports the claim that...?"*

| Level | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **4** | Selects the strongest evidence; can articulate WHY it's stronger than alternatives; understands degrees of support |
| **3** | Selects appropriate evidence; understands connection to claim |
| **2** | Selects evidence that partially supports the claim or selects weaker evidence over stronger options |
| **1** | Selects evidence that doesn't support the claim or misunderstands the relationship |

**Feedback Prompts:**
- Level 4: "Perfect! You identified the strongest evidence and understand why it's more convincing than other options."
- Level 3: "Good choice. Think about what makes evidence STRONG vs. just okay."
- Level 2: "This evidence relates to the topic, but does it DIRECTLY prove the specific claim?"
- Level 1: "Evidence needs to PROVE the claim. Ask: Does this detail actually show what the claim says?"

---

### Inference Questions
*"What can you infer about...?"*

| Level | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **4** | Makes sophisticated inferences supported by multiple textual clues; can explain reasoning; distinguishes between stated and implied |
| **3** | Makes reasonable inferences supported by text; understands implicit meaning |
| **2** | Makes inferences but may over-interpret or under-support with textual evidence |
| **1** | Unable to make inferences; sticks only to explicit statements or makes unsupported guesses |

**Feedback Prompts:**
- Level 4: "Excellent inference! You combined multiple clues to draw a well-supported conclusion."
- Level 3: "Good inference. Can you point to the specific clues that led you there?"
- Level 2: "Your inference is creative, but does the TEXT actually support it? What's your evidence?"
- Level 1: "Inference means reading between the lines. What clues does the author give without saying directly?"

---

### Vocabulary Questions
*"What does [word] mean in this context?"*

| Level | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **4** | Uses multiple context clues to determine precise meaning; understands connotation and nuance |
| **3** | Uses context clues effectively to determine meaning |
| **2** | Understands approximate meaning but may miss nuance or rely on one clue |
| **1** | Unable to use context; guesses or uses wrong meaning |

**Feedback Prompts:**
- Level 4: "Perfect! You used the surrounding context to determine the precise meaning."
- Level 3: "Good use of context clues. Pay attention to the TONE—is the word positive, negative, or neutral?"
- Level 2: "You're close. Read the sentence before and after—what clues help narrow down the meaning?"
- Level 1: "Look at the words AROUND the unfamiliar word. What would make sense in that spot?"

## Overall Reading Score Interpretation

| Score | Level | Interpretation | Recommended Action |
|-------|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| 80-100% | **Level 4** | Exceeds Standard | Challenge with more complex texts; peer tutoring opportunities |
| 70-79% | **Level 3** | Meets Standard | Reinforce skills; introduce more sophisticated questioning |
| 60-69% | **Level 2** | Approaching | Targeted instruction on weak skill areas; more practice |

# PART 2: WRITING ASSESSMENT

## The Four Assessment Categories

Writing is assessed on four equally-weighted categories (25% each):

1. **Main Message & Focus** - Is the main point clear from the start?
2. **Logical Structure** - Do supporting points connect to the main message?
3. **Grouping & Completeness** - Are ideas organized without overlap?
4. **Conventions & Clarity** - Is the writing clear and error-free?

---

## Detailed Writing Rubric

### Category 1: Main Message & Focus (25%)

| Level | Score | Criteria | Look For |
|-------|-------|----------|----------|
| **4** | 80-100% | Main message is crystal clear from the opening; reader immediately understands the point; thesis is specific and arguable | • Main point in paragraph 1 • Specific, not vague • No guessing required |
| **3** | 70-79% | Main message is clear and stated early in the writing; reader can identify the point | • Main point clearly present • Stated in introduction • Mostly specific |
| **2** | 60-69% | Main message is present but may be buried or unclear; reader has to search for it | • Main point exists • May be in middle/end • Somewhat vague |
| **1** | 50-59% | Main message is missing or very difficult to identify; reader unsure of the point | • No clear main point • Multiple competing ideas • Reader confused |

**Questions to Ask:**
- Can I state the student's main message in ONE sentence?
- Where does the main message appear? (Should be paragraph 1)
- Is the main message specific or vague?
- Would a reader know the point after the first paragraph?

**Sample Feedback:**
- Level 4: "Your main message is crystal clear from the start. The reader knows exactly what you're arguing."
- Level 3: "Good clear thesis. Try moving it earlier in your introduction to grab the reader faster."
- Level 2: "I found your main point in paragraph 3. Move it to paragraph 1—don't make readers wait."
- Level 1: "I'm not sure what your main message is. Try completing this sentence: 'The ONE thing I want my reader to understand is...'"

---

### Category 2: Logical Structure (25%)

| Level | Score | Criteria | Look For |
|-------|-------|----------|----------|
| **4** | 80-100% | Each paragraph directly answers 'why?' or 'how?' about the main message; points are distinct and build logically | • Clear paragraph purposes • Logical flow • Strong transitions • Each point connects to thesis |
| **3** | 70-79% | Supporting points connect to main message with clear logic; structure is easy to follow | • Mostly clear connections • Good organization • Minor gaps in logic |
| **2** | 60-69% | Some connection between points and main message, but logic may be unclear or jumpy | • Some connections present • Logic gaps • Unclear transitions |
| **1** | 50-59% | Points seem disconnected or don't clearly support the main message | • Unclear how points connect • Random organization • Reader gets lost |

**Questions to Ask:**
- Does each body paragraph answer "why?" or "how?" about the main message?
- Can I follow the student's reasoning from start to finish?
- Are transitions clear between paragraphs?
- Does each paragraph have ONE clear purpose?

**Sample Feedback:**
- Level 4: "Your structure is excellent. Each paragraph clearly supports your main message, and I can follow your logic perfectly."
- Level 3: "Good organization. Strengthen your transitions to show HOW each point connects to your thesis."
- Level 2: "Paragraph 3 seems disconnected. Ask yourself: How does this point answer 'why?' about my main message?"
- Level 1: "I'm having trouble following your reasoning. Try outlining your points—does each one DIRECTLY support your main idea?"

---

### Category 3: Grouping & Completeness (25%)

| Level | Score | Criteria | Look For |
|-------|-------|----------|----------|
| **4** | 80-100% | Ideas are perfectly grouped; no overlap between points; nothing important is missing; MECE principle followed | • Each point is distinct • No repetition • Comprehensive coverage • Clear categories |
| **3** | 70-79% | Ideas are well-grouped with minimal overlap; covers main points adequately | • Mostly distinct points • Minor overlap • Covers key points |
| **2** | 60-69% | Some grouping attempted but ideas may overlap or important points may be missing | • Some overlap • Missing arguments • Partial coverage |
| **1** | 50-59% | Ideas are jumbled, repetitive, or major points are missing | • Significant repetition • Major gaps • Poor grouping |

**Questions to Ask:**
- Are the supporting points DIFFERENT from each other, or variations of the same idea?
- Is there repetition disguised as different points?
- Are there obvious arguments or points the student missed?
- Together, do the points cover the topic comprehensively?

**Sample Feedback:**
- Level 4: "Excellent! Your points are distinct, don't overlap, and together they cover everything important."
- Level 3: "Good grouping. Points 2 and 3 overlap slightly—could you combine them or make them more distinct?"
- Level 2: "Your first two points are actually the same idea in different words. How can you make them truly different?"
- Level 1: "Several of your points repeat the same idea. Also, you're missing [important argument]. What other types of evidence could you use?"

---

### Category 4: Conventions & Clarity (25%)

| Level | Score | Criteria | Look For |
|-------|-------|----------|----------|
| **4** | 80-100% | Virtually no errors; writing is exceptionally clear; varied sentence structure; precise word choice | • Error-free • Excellent flow • Sophisticated vocabulary • Varied sentences |
| **3** | 70-79% | Few errors that don't impede understanding; clear writing; good sentence variety | • Minor errors • Clear expression • Good variety |
| **2** | 60-69% | Some errors that may impede understanding; adequate clarity; limited variety | • Noticeable errors • Some confusion • Repetitive structures |
| **1** | 50-59% | Frequent errors that significantly impede understanding; unclear expression | • Many errors • Hard to understand • Basic vocabulary |

**Questions to Ask:**
- Are there spelling or grammar errors?
- Is there sentence variety (short + long, simple + complex)?
- Is word choice precise or vague?
- Can I understand what the student means easily?

**Sample Feedback:**
- Level 4: "Your writing is clear, polished, and engaging. Excellent command of conventions."
- Level 3: "Good writing with few errors. Try varying your sentence lengths more for better flow."
- Level 2: "Some errors are distracting. Proofread aloud—you'll catch more mistakes that way."
- Level 1: "Multiple errors make this hard to follow. Focus on one paragraph at a time and check each sentence."

## Writing Score Calculation

Calculate the final score by averaging the four categories:

**Example:**
- Main Message & Focus: Level 3 (75%)
- Logical Structure: Level 4 (85%)
- Grouping & Completeness: Level 3 (72%)
- Conventions & Clarity: Level 3 (78%)

**Average:** (75 + 85 + 72 + 78) ÷ 4 = **77.5% (Level 3)**

## Quick Assessment Checklist

Use this checklist for efficient assessment:

### Main Message & Focus
☐ Main point present? Where? (Para 1 = good, later = needs work)
☐ Specific or vague?
☐ Clearly stated or reader must guess?

### Logical Structure
☐ Each paragraph has ONE clear purpose?
☐ Each point answers "why?" or "how?" about thesis?
☐ Clear transitions between paragraphs?
☐ Reader can follow the logic?

### Grouping & Completeness
☐ Points are different from each other?
☐ Any repetition/overlap?
☐ Missing any obvious arguments?
☐ Together, points cover the topic?

### Conventions & Clarity
☐ Spelling/grammar errors? (Count them)
☐ Sentence variety?
☐ Clear expression?
☐ Word count met?

## Providing Effective Feedback

### The Feedback Sandwich (Recommended Structure)

1. **Strength** - What did the student do well?
2. **Growth Area** - What's the most important thing to improve?
3. **Action Step** - Specific strategy to improve

**Example:**
> "Your main message is clear and you have good evidence (strength). Your points 2 and 3 overlap—they're both about cost savings (growth area). Try asking: 'Is this a DIFFERENT type of argument, or the same idea in different words?' (action step)"

### Focus on ONE Thing

Don't overwhelm students with all errors. Prioritize:
1. Main message issues (most important)
2. Structure issues
3. Grouping issues
4. Conventions (least urgent unless severe)

### Use the Student's Language

Reference their actual writing:
> "When you wrote 'Screen time is really important for lots of reasons,' that's vague. Try: 'Screen time benefits learning through access to educational resources, global connection, and skill development.'"

## Red Flags to Watch For

### Reading
- Student consistently misidentifies main ideas → Focus on distinguishing detail from theme
- Student can't use context clues → Vocabulary instruction needed
- Student over-interprets or invents information → Focus on text evidence

### Writing
- Main message buried or missing → Direct instruction on thesis placement
- Points repeat same idea → Teach MECE concept (different types of arguments)
- Points don't connect to thesis → Practice vertical logic ("why?" test)
- Student writes without planning → Enforce Think First framework

---

## Tracking Progress Over Time

Recommended tracking categories:
1. Central message identification
2. Evidence evaluation
3. Text structure recognition
4. Main message clarity (writing)
5. Logical structure (writing)
6. Grouping without overlap (writing)

Track level scores across assessments to identify:
- Consistent strengths
- Persistent growth areas
- Skill improvement over time

---

## Quick Reference Card

**Reading Assessment - What to Look For:**
1. Can student identify the ONE main idea?
2. Can student recognize HOW the author builds their argument?
3. Can student evaluate which evidence is strongest?
4. Can student make inferences from implied information?

**Writing Assessment - What to Look For:**
1. Is the main message clear in paragraph 1?
2. Does each paragraph answer "why?" or "how?" about the main message?
3. Are points different from each other (no overlap)?
4. Together, do points cover everything important?

**The Single Most Important Question:**
> "Can I follow the student's thinking from start to finish?"

If yes → Strong structured thinker
If no → Focus on logical organization first
